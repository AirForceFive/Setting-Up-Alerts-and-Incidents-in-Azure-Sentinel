# Setting Up Alerts and Incidents in Azure Sentinel

## Introduction

Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR) solution. In this project, we'll demonstrate how to configure alerts and incidents in Azure Sentinel to enhance the security monitoring and response of our Azure infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription.
- Azure Sentinel workspace set up and connected to relevant data sources.

## Steps to Set Up Alerts

### 1. Navigate to Azure Sentinel

- Open Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure Sentinel workspace.

### 2. Access Analytics

- Under the `Configuration` section, select `Analytics`.

### 3. Create a Rule

- Click on `+ Create` and fill out the rule template.
  - **Rule name**: Name of the alert.
  - **Tactics**: The tactics the rule addresses (e.g., Initial Access, Execution).
  - **Severity**: The severity level of the alert (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

### 4. Define Rule Logic

- Set up the Kusto Query Language (KQL) logic that will trigger the alert.

### 5. Configure Incident Creation

- Decide if an incident should be created for each alert or if they should be grouped together based on specific attributes.

### 6. Review and Create

- Review the rule configuration and click `Create`.

## Steps to Set Up Incidents

### 1. Navigate to Incidents Page

- In Azure Sentinel, go to the `Incidents` tab.

### 2. Review and Assign

- Review the generated incidents.
- Assign them to a security analyst or team.

### 3. Investigate Incidents

- Click on an incident to view details.
- Use the built-in investigation tools to understand the scope, assets involved, and potential impact.

### 4. Remediate and Close

- Take necessary actions to remediate the threats.
- Once resolved, close the incident and document any findings or lessons learned.

## Setting Up Automated Response

Azure Sentinel also allows you to automate responses to specific incidents:

1. Navigate to the `Playbooks` section in Azure Sentinel.
2. Click on `+ Add new playbook`.
3. Define the automated response logic using Logic Apps. This can range from sending an email notification to more complex workflows.

## Conclusion

Azure Sentinel provides robust capabilities to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. By setting up alerts and incidents effectively, organizations can proactively monitor threats and enhance their security posture in the cloud. Regularly reviewing and updating the rules helps in staying ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats.
